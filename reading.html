                <h2>LockSoc Recommended Reading</h2>
                <p>Many of these deal with many aspects of physical security, 
                from locks and safes, to the psychological and human aspects 
                of creating and implementing secure systems.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, many of these resources are hard to 
                acquire, they don't seem to exist in any meaningful sense on 
                Amazon, and they don't appear in our library.</p>
                <h3>Society Loans</h3>
                <p>As a rule, the LockSoc does not keep copies of the documents
                on this list, and cannot loan them out.</p>
                <p>However, some of the membership does have privately-held 
                copies. If you're interested in one of the harder-to-find or 
                expensive resources, ask around. Please bear in mind that some
                of these documents are hard to come by or simply very expensive
                or bulky.</p>
                <h3>Locks</h3>
                <p>These primarily cover the workings and attack strategies of 
                many existing kinds of locks.</p>
                <h4>MIT Guide to Lock picking</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author: Ted the Tool</li>
                    <li>Type: Introductory Guide</li>
                    <li>Length: 49 pages</li>
                    <li>Common Format: PDF file</li>
                    <li>Availability: Web Search</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is also sometimes referred to as &quot;The Document 
                Which Used to be Called The MIT Guide To Lock Picking&quot;</p>
                <p>It describes the operational principles of pin-tumbler locks,
                and the defects which lead to it's failure. Towards the end, 
                the guide covers security pins, master keys and even simple 
                wafer locks.</p>
                <p>It is short (49 pages, several of which are large diagrams), 
                and has very good diagrams, and as such makes for an excellent 
                starting point.</p>
                <p>It can often be turned up by a simple web search, but many 
                members have a copy.</p>
                <h3>Safes</h3>
                <p>Safes and vaults hold intrigue, but actually, many of them 
                use common, simple locking mechanisms, and fall prey to simple
                attacks.</p>
                <h4>Safecracking for the Computer Scientist</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author: Matt Blaze</li>
                    <li>Type: Introductory Guide</li>
                    <li>Length: 34 pages</li>
                    <li>Common Format: PDF File</li>
                    <li>Availability: Web Search</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This short overview provides a whirl-wind tour of 
                safecracking. It's main focus is simple rotary combination lock
                safes, with some additional security features (for example, 
                re-lockers). It covers manipulation attacks, brute-force and 
                drilling, and mentions common methods of defense against such 
                attacks.</p>
                <p>It's list of references is very illuminating, and worth 
                having a look.</p>

                <h3>Operational Security</h3>
                <p>The design and operation of a secure system is extremely 
                difficult, and must take into account many factors, such as 
                human psychology, cryptography, and, of course, physical 
                security. These resources give a treatment to the workings of 
                such systems.</p>
                <h4>The NSA Security Manual</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author: Undisclosed</li>
                    <li>Type: Institutional Guidelines</li>
                    <li>Length: 16 pages</li>

                    <li>Availability: Web Search, see below also.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Leaked sometime ago by an anonymous source at the National 
                Security Agency, the guide covers many aspects of the day-to-day 
                requirements of working at the agency, for example, badges must
                be worn at all times, and how to answer questions from the 
                public as to the job.</p>
                <p>It provides an interesting insight into how operational 
                security affects personel &quot;on the ground&quot; in an area 
                that's long been clandestine and very cloak &amp; dagger.</p>
                <p>The manual can be found on <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/nsaman.pdf">Ross Anderson's webpages</a>.</p>
                <h4>Security Engineering</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Author: Ross Anderson</li>
                    <li>Type: Book (Tome)</li>
                    <li>Length: 1040 pages</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Written in 1998, and updated in 2008, Ross Anderson's 
                Security Engineering gives a solid treatment to it's namesake. 
                It concerns itself with security as a process to be applied to 
                an institution.</p>
                <p>Security Engineering provides several insights, as well as 
                case studies from Nuclear Command &amp; Control, Banking &amp; 
                Book-keeping, and other systems commonly expected to be 
                &quot;high security&quot;.</p>
                <p>Ross has convinced his publisher to allow all of the chapters
                to be posted individually on <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html">the book's website</a></p>

                <p>This book is alleged to be an extremely good reference on the
                security of it's namesakes. I have not yet got myself a copy. 
                Amazon offers a copy for a price in excess of Â£100, and the 
                publisher offers a hardback copy at over $219.95.</p>
