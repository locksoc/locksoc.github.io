                <h2>About LockSoc</h2>
                <h3>Who are we?</h3>
                <p>We are a group of people at The University of York, UK who 
                enjoy exploring and defeating locks that we own.</p>
                <h3>What do we do?</h3>
                <p>A typical meetup will have us picking locks of varying 
                difficulties, as well as talking about all aspects of security.
                </p>
                <p>During each term, we also host events, from talks and 
                instructional workshops, to friendly competitions and even the
                odd social.</p>
                <h3>Committee</h3>
                <p>LockSoc is a newly formed society, and does not as yet have 
                any formal comittee</p>
                <p>A committee will be elected shortly. If you are interested
                in running for a position, please contact us.</p>
                <h4>Positions</h4>
                <p>As per YUSU rules, there will be at least 3 positions 
                available in the society:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chair</li>
                    <li>Secretary</li>
                    <li>Treasurer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is also likely to be scope for other positions, for 
                example, we will likely need someone to deal with all aspects
                of the society's equipment.</p>
