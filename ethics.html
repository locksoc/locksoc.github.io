                <h2>Ethics</h2>
                <p>Our ethical policy is quite simple, and follows that of many 
                existing locksport and lockpicking organisations, such as <a 
                    href="https://toool.org.uk">The Open Organisation Of 
                    Lockpickers</a>.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Be mindful of the consequences of your actions. This 
                    includes how your actions may appear to those who are not
                    a part of our community.</li>
                    <li>Never pick a lock that you do not have the owner's 
                    express consent to pick. If you have any doubt as to a 
                    person's lawful authority over a lock, don't pick it.</li>
                    <li>Never pick a lock that is relied upon. For instance, 
                    picking the lock on the front door of your house is a Bad
                    Idea, and will likely result in you breaking your 
                    lock, and rendering your house insecure for some time.</li>
                    <li>Never pick a lock that is in use, for instance, if a 
                    lock is securing a bicycle, don't pick it, even with the 
                    owner's consent.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>A liberal application of the above guidelines should help 
                keep you out of trouble. It basically boils down to &quot;If 
                it seems shifty, stay away.&quot;</p>
